```

## Scope
At present the scope of the implementation of this Cake addin is to meet my own requirements, which are primarily to support a client side build process for a typical .NET based web application.  
This process would usual involve a design or creative team developing and maintaining client side assets (js, scss) for which they have a gulp based development and build workflow.

My goal to be to able to support this workflow as part of a complete solution build.

### I cant do <insert-function-here>
